# Complete Guide to Publishing Your Sky Snake Game

This guide will walk you through the process of publishing your Sky Snake Game to GitHub and making it accessible to anyone in the world.

## Step 1: Prepare Your Files

You have two ZIP files:
1. `sky-snake-game-code.zip` - Contains all the code files (HTML, JavaScript, etc.)
2. The audio files (`Elysium.mp3` and `eating-sound.wav`) need to be uploaded separately

## Step 2: Upload to GitHub

### 2.1 Go to Your GitHub Repository

1. Open your web browser
2. Go to: https://github.com/supriyosen/SkySnakeGame
3. Make sure you're logged into your GitHub account

### 2.2 Upload Code Files First

1. Click the "Add file" button near the top right of the repository page
2. Select "Upload files" from the dropdown menu
3. Drag and drop or select these files from your computer:
   - `index.html`
   - `missing-functions.js`
   - `README.md`
   - `favicon.svg`
   - `.gitignore`
   - `test.html`
4. Add a commit message: "Add Sky Snake Game code files"
5. Click the "Commit changes" button
6. Wait for the upload to complete

### 2.3 Upload Audio Files Separately

1. After the code files are uploaded, click the "Add file" button again
2. Select "Upload files" from the dropdown menu
3. Drag and drop or select `Elysium.mp3` (the background music file)
4. Add a commit message: "Add background music"
5. Click the "Commit changes" button
6. Wait for the upload to complete

7. Repeat the process for `eating-sound.wav`:
   - Click the "Add file" button
   - Select "Upload files"
   - Drag and drop or select `eating-sound.wav`
   - Add a commit message: "Add eating sound effect"
   - Click the "Commit changes" button
   - Wait for the upload to complete

## Step 3: Enable GitHub Pages

1. After uploading all files, click on "Settings" in the top navigation bar
2. In the left sidebar, click on "Pages"
3. Under "Source", change the dropdown from "None" to "main"
4. Click "Save"
5. Wait 5-10 minutes for GitHub to deploy your site

## Step 4: Access Your Game

Your game will be available at:
https://supriyosen.github.io/SkySnakeGame/

This is the link you can share with anyone in the world!

## Step 5: Verify Everything Works

1. Visit the link above
2. Make sure the game loads properly
3. Test that all features work:
   - Background music plays
   - Snake movement works
   - Food collection works
   - Score updates
   - Sound effects play when eating food

## Troubleshooting

### If your game doesn't appear:
1. Make sure GitHub Pages is enabled (check Settings > Pages)
2. Verify all files were uploaded successfully
3. Wait a few more minutes (GitHub Pages can take time to deploy)
4. Clear your browser cache and try again

### If you see a 404 error:
1. Double-check the URL (it should be https://supriyosen.github.io/SkySnakeGame/)
2. Make sure your repository name is exactly "SkySnakeGame"
3. Verify that index.html is in the root of your repository

### If audio doesn't play:
1. Check that both audio files (`Elysium.mp3` and `eating-sound.wav`) were uploaded successfully
2. Verify that the file names match exactly what's referenced in the code
3. Some browsers require user interaction before playing audio - click somewhere on the game to enable audio

## Sharing Your Game

Once your game is published, you can share the link with anyone:
- Share on social media
- Send via email or messaging apps
- Include in your portfolio
- Add to your resume

Enjoy sharing your Sky Snake Game with the world!
